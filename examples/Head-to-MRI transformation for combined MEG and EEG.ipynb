    "When an EEG cap is placed on the head, it is not recommended to even try to digitise extra points on the head: these would be _very_ likely to end up not touching the scalp under the cap and lead to a poor coregistration. On the other hand, EEG electrodes are digitised such that the _scalp point_ in the middle of the ring is chosen as the location. EEG electrode locations can thus be used as \"extra\" points in the coregistration.\n",
